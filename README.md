## Background and Goals
Writing specs for FIX **sucks**. QuickFIX-doc helps you "save time and look good" by taking care of the specification generation for you.

All you need is a valid QuickFIX data dictionary. No need for any custom word documents, no chance for human error, just run and view your nice beautiful spec.

QuickFIX-doc parses the QuickFIX data dictionary .xml files into descriptive [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) files using [RstCloth](https://pypi.org/project/rstcloth/), and then runs them through the [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/) documentation generation library for Python.
